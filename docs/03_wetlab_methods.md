# Wet-lab methods (qPCR validation)

## Study population
Patients with sporadic invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) referred to Sina and Farmaniyeh hospitals (Tehran). Patients had not received chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to excision.

## Sampling and storage
Tumour tissue and adjacent non-tumour tissue were collected. Samples were transported on liquid nitrogen and stored at −70°C.

## RNA extraction
RNA extraction was performed under sterile conditions. Tissue was homogenised in liquid nitrogen, and RNA was extracted using AccuZol Total RNA Extraction Solution with chloroform/isopropanol precipitation and ethanol wash.

## RNA quality control
- Qualitative QC: 1% agarose gel electrophoresis; clear 18S and 28S rRNA bands
- Quantitative QC: NanoDrop 260 nm measurement; A260/A280 ratio in the range ~1.6–2.0

## DNase treatment
Genomic DNA contamination was removed using DNase I (RNase-free) according to the kit protocol.

## cDNA synthesis
cDNA synthesis used both Oligo(dT) and Random hexamer primers to cover coding and non-coding RNAs. Thermal cycling followed the kit instructions.

## cDNA quality check (RT-PCR)
RT-PCR was performed using GAPDH primers and visualised by agarose gel electrophoresis.

## Real-time PCR (SYBR Green)
- Instrument: ABI StepOnePlus
- Chemistry: SYBR Green (RealQ Plus Master Mix Green)
- Cycling: 40 cycles; melt curve from 70–95°C
- Primer design: AlleleID and NCBI Primer-BLAST
- Specificity checks: melt curve + gel electrophoresis; primer-dimer troubleshooting performed as needed.
