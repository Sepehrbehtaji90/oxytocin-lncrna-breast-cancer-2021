Why these genes/lncRNAs?
========================

Purpose
-------
This repository documents and reproduces the workflow behind our 2021 Scientific Reports study on
oxytocin-pathway-related genes and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) in breast cancer.

The target list was not chosen arbitrarily. It was built using a combination of:
(1) pathway-driven biology (oxytocin signalling and related calcium/cAMP signalling components),
(2) unbiased discovery from public microarray data (GSE54002),
(3) prior experimental evidence linking specific lncRNAs to downstream target genes (siRNA knockdown + microarray studies),
and (4) literature review to ensure biological plausibility and relevance to cancer phenotypes.

Target genes and lncRNAs
------------------------
lncRNAs:
- LincMTX2 (LINC01116 / TALNEC2)
- LincTNS1 (DIRC3)
- LincZFP161 (LINC00667)
- LincFOXF1 (FENDRR)
(Additional candidates may appear in early drafts; the final set matches the 2021 publication.)

Target genes:
- OXTR
- CAMK2D
- ITPR1
- RCAN1
- CACNA2D1
- FOS
(Other genes mentioned in the proposal are not necessarily included in the final publication.)

Selection logic (step-by-step)
------------------------------
1) Public microarray discovery (GSE54002):
   - Differential expression between tumour and non-tumour samples was computed using limma.
   - From down-regulated genes, those associated with the oxytocin signalling pathway were prioritised.

2) Pathway enrichment and network context:
   - Enrichment analysis (Enrichr/KEGG) was used to identify pathway-level relevance.
   - Protein interaction/network context (STRING/Cytoscape) was used to identify hubs and connected components.

3) lncRNA-to-target mapping (evidence-based):
   - Candidate lncRNAs were selected based on published perturbation studies (siRNA knockdown followed by microarray),
     which provide directional evidence that certain lncRNAs influence the expression of specific target genes.
   - As an additional check, target genes were queried in lncRNA–target resources (e.g., lnc2target) to confirm support.

4) Literature review:
   - The final list was cross-checked against prior studies reporting altered expression, prognostic associations, or functional relevance
     for genes such as OXTR, ITPR1, FOS, CACNA2D1, RGS2 (context), and related signalling components across cancers.
