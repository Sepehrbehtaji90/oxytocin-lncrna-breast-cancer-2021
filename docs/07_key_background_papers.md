1) Makoukji et al. (2016) — microarray profiling in Lebanese breast cancer cohort

What they did: Microarray gene-expression profiling of 84 breast tumors vs 10 adjacent non-tumor samples, then validated candidates with qPCR.
Why it matters for your project: It supports the idea that oxytocin-pathway–related genes (your proposal mentions OXTR) can show altered expression in breast cancer tissue vs non-tumor controls—i.e., your “tumor vs adjacent normal” design is aligned with prior work.
Strength: Human clinical tissues + independent validation.
Limitations (for your specific aim): It doesn’t connect OXTR to specific lncRNA regulators, and population/cohort differences can affect gene-expression signatures (so it’s supportive, not definitive).

2) Khalil et al. (GSE16226) — knockdown + microarray to infer lncRNA→target links

What they did: siRNA knockdown experiments followed by microarray profiling, producing inferred relationships between specific lncRNAs and downstream target genes (your proposal uses this as the basis for mapping lncRNAs like lincTNS1, lincMTX2, lincFOXF1, lincZFP161 to targets in your pathway list).
Why it matters: This is the “bridge” from genes to lncRNAs—without something like this, your lncRNA choices could look arbitrary.
Strength: Mechanism-oriented design (perturbation → response), which is more convincing than pure correlation.
Limitations: Knockdown systems are cell/context dependent; the lncRNA→gene relationships should be treated as candidate regulatory links, not universal truth. Your validation step (qPCR in patient tissues) is exactly how you strengthen this.

3) Gu et al. (2016) — autophagy-related prognostic signature in breast cancer (includes ITPR1 and FOS)

What they did: Built a prognostic signature for breast cancer using Cox regression; identified an 8-gene set associated with overall survival, including ITPR1 and FOS.
Why it matters: Your proposal includes ITPR1 and FOS; this paper supports that these genes can be clinically meaningful (survival-linked), which backs your “biomarker potential” motivation.
Strength: Outcome-linked (prognosis), not just differential expression.
Limitations: It’s not oxytocin-pathway–specific, and signatures can be dataset-dependent; you still need your own diagnostic/ROC analysis to claim discriminatory power in your cohort.

4) Wang et al. (2018) — RGS2 downregulation + survival association in invasive breast carcinoma (NST)

What they did: Reported that low RGS2 expression is associated with poorer overall survival; includes Kaplan–Meier analyses and additional supporting analyses (including TCGA-based work).
Why it matters: RGS2 is in your gene list (and sits in signaling control territory), so this gives external backing that reduced expression isn’t just “noise”—it can track with prognosis.
Strength: Links expression to clinical outcome.
Limitations: Different cohorts/platforms + subtype differences can shift effect sizes; also, this doesn’t directly test oxytocin signaling, so it’s supportive context rather than direct pathway evidence.

5) Yu et al. (2016) — CACNA2D1 as a prognostic marker in epithelial ovarian cancer

What they did: Retrospective study in epithelial ovarian cancer reporting that CACNA2D1 expression is associated with poor outcomes / aggressive behavior markers.
Why it matters for your project: CACNA2D1 is on your target list (calcium signaling component); this paper supports the general idea that dysregulation of this calcium-channel subunit can matter clinically in cancer—helpful for biological plausibility.
Strength: Adds clinical/prognostic relevance for CACNA2D1 in cancer.
Limitation (big one): It’s not breast cancer, so you should frame it as cross-cancer plausibility, not direct evidence for breast.
