# Project overview

## Working hypothesis
Oxytocin signalling pathway genes may be involved in breast cancer pathogenesis. This project investigates the expression of oxytocin-pathway-related lncRNAs in breast cancer tissues and matched adjacent normal tissues.

This work focuses on the following lncRNAs and target genes:
- lncRNAs: LincMTX2 (LINC01116 / TALNEC2), LincTNS1 (DIRC3), LincZFP161 (LINC00667), LincFOXF1 (FENDRR)
- Target genes: RCAN1, ITPR1, CAMK2D, OXTR, FOS, CACNA2D1

## High-level workflow
1. Literature review and target selection
2. Bioinformatics discovery using GEO microarray data (GSE54002) and limma
3. Pathway enrichment (Enrichr / KEGG) and interaction network analysis (STRING / Cytoscape)
4. Wet-lab validation: RNA extraction → DNase → cDNA synthesis → qPCR
5. Statistics, correlations, and diagnostic modelling (ROC / ML)

## Note
This repository was created in 2026 to document and reproduce the workflow behind the 2021 publication.
